=head1 NAME

DbToRia Development

=head2 DESCRIPTION

With the basic structure of DbToRia in place, the feature set is still
incomplete. The following work packages are largely independent. They
will lead to a fully working DbToRia version with a feature set
similar to that of Gedafe, allowing drop-in replacement of Gedafe
without modifications to the database.

The current project leader (PL) of DbToRia is Tobi Oetiker.
