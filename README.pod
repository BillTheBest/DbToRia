DbToRia - Database to Rich Internet Application

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DbToRia is generic sql database frontend. Just point it to your database and
get a user friendly web interface. By providing DbToRia with additional
information about the nature of your database the userinterface can be
further optimized.

=head1 SETUP

=head2 Quick Start

We assume you have DBI and the respektive DBD module for your database already installed.
Now get Mojo and the Mojo qooxdoo dispatcher and the config grammar module:

 cd backend/setup
 ./make_thirdparty.sh

Edit the F<backend/etc/dbtoria.cfg> file to point to the database of your choice.

With this set you are ready to run dbtoria with its built in webserver for testing

 ./backend/bin/dbtoria.pl daemon

(oh and you need to build the frontend and you need to setup a databse ... will describe later)
